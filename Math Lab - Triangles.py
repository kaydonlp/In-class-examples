# Math Lab - Triangle

#Create and assign values to base and height

base = 100

height = 50.0

# Create an "area" variable and set it equal to the expression "0.5 * base * height".
area = 0.5 * base * height

# This will calculate the area of a triangle. Then print the area to the screen.
print (area)

# Use the type() and print() functions to print the type of the "area" variable
print (area)
area_type = type(area)
print (area_type)
